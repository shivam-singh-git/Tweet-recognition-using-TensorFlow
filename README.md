<h1>NLP Tweet Sentiment Analysis using LSTM</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This project focuses on sentiment analysis of tweets using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The goal is to classify tweets into different sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) based on their textual content.</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Code:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The code is written in Python and utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for building and training LSTM models.</li>
            <li>It includes scripts for data preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.</li>
            <li>Key components such as tokenization, padding, model architecture, training, and evaluation are documented within the code.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The dataset consists of labeled tweet data split into training, testing, and validation sets.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Usage:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>To use the project:
                <ol>
                    <li>Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.</li>
                    <li>Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.</li>
                    <li>Run the provided Python scripts to preprocess data, build and train the LSTM model, and evaluate its performance.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>The project requires the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Python 3.x</li>
    <li>TensorFlow</li>
    <li>Keras</li>
    <li>NumPy</li>
    <li>Pandas</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>NLP library</li>
</ul>

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>

<p>The LSTM model architecture consists of an embedding layer, followed by bidirectional LSTM layers and a dense output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.</p>

<h2>Training and Evaluation</h2>

<p>The model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on both validation and test datasets. Performance metrics such as loss and accuracy are computed to assess the model's effectiveness in sentiment classification.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To use the project:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Install the required dependencies using pip or conda.</li>
    <li>Run the main Python script to preprocess the data, train the LSTM model, and evaluate its performance.</li>
</ol>
